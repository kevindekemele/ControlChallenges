# ControlChallenges
This control game is based on initial work of JanisMac (https://github.com/janismac/ControlChallenges)
My goal is to create a educational simulation tool. For each system, students need to find the model, and then create a suitable controller.

TODO:
- Make functions for common linear controllers as PID, phase lead/lag OR based on phase and gain margin
- Documentation of the mathematical models
- Include model based functions
